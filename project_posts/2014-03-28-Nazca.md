This is the submission post.
Summary of our project is follows:

##Work and Build Environment
 - Kinect is required. To run with a camera device (face recognition) instead of kinect, define preprocessor macro, "USE_MAC_CAM”.
 - HTTP Server is required. Please upload “Nazca.html” and “”Nazca.js” on your web server and define URL at preprocesser macro, “URL”.

##Issues to Know
 - The application may not recognize multiple users.
 - Not implement asynchronous communication, so it takes time to pass data to Awesomium from oF.

##Keyboard Shortcuts
 - space key: Capture the user mask
 - a: Draw the user mask on google map
 - r: Reload google map
 - 1: Zoom in
 - 2: Zoom out

##Future Works
 - Bug fix for multiple user recognition.
 - Auto capture system.
 - Implement asynchronous communication between oF project and awesomium.
