We discuss the direction of our project.

Our inspiration is the Nazca Lines.

The Nazca Lines were one of the seven wonders of the world.
And the purpose and the drawing method are still discussed.
Did they send the signs to aliens? I don’t know.

We discussed that we the human beings may unconsciously create big art on the earth and send signs to aliens.

Our project is to draw your face on the earth.


Here is the rough sketch.
