I draw my face on google map.

![nazca004](../project_images/nazca_004.jpg?raw=false “nazca_004”)

But it takes a lot of time to draw because this system calls too many google map API queries. API returns over_query_limit. And our solution at the moment is cutting down the FPS.
 
We have to solve this problem.
