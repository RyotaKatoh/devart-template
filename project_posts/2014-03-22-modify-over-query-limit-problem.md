I modified the code for google map API OVER_QUERY_LIMIT problem.
Now, I can draw the direction lines continuously.

And we discussed it is better to use kinect because it can extract the contour very well and it is more like Nazca Lines.

We could not still merge our source code. But unit test has done.
Here is the movie of our project (Note: this movie is not using Kinect. I think it is more interesting if it use Kinect.)
