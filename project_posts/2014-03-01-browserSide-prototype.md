I create browser side prototype. 
Here is the prototype image. You can draw simple geoglyph on Google Map.
(I drew this image by my hand. Our goal is to draw automatically.)

![nazca002](../project_images/nazca_002.jpg?raw=false “nazcaß002”)

Next stage is embedding this browser image to openFrameworks.

My friend is developing image processing side with oF.
