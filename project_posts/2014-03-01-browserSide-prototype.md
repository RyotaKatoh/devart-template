I create browser side prototype. 
Here is the prototype image. You can draw simple geoglyph on Google Map.
(I drew this image by my hand. Our goal is to draw automatically.)

![Sketch002](../project_images/sketch_002.jpg?raw=false “Sketch002”)

Next stage is embedding this browser image to openFrameworks.

My friend is developing image processing side with oF.
